## Project Overview
This project was part of my Year 12 Computer Science course to investigate control systems. I chose to design a traffic light system using an Arduino Uno and an ultrasonic distance sensor to record and account for pedestrians, when controlling the lights, to reduce congestion and improve traffic.
